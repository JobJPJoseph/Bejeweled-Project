# Bejeweled

In this project, you will create a command-line Bejeweled game. Unlike
previous projects, you will be start by implementing test specs in
`bejeweled-spec.js` for the game logic. Once these specs are in place, you can
implement the game logic in `bejeweled.js`.

To render the game, you have been given a `Screen` API that handles
command-line rendering. You do not need to understand how the code in `Screen`
works but you will need to make use of the commands provided. The API is
documented below. Try out the commands to see how they work.

To process keypresses, you will need to load `Command` objects into the Screen
API using `Screen.addCommand`. This function takes a `key` which triggers the
command, a string `description`, and an `action` callback which is executed
when `key` is pressed.

In order to swap items, you will need to add extra cursor controls: one to
select an item and one to execute the swap. You can only swap adjacent items.

## Bejeweled rules

Bejeweled is a game that requires you to match three of the same item in a row
either horizontally or vertically by swapping items. When you do this, the
matched items disappear and new items above it fall to fill the gaps.

Example:

```
 游볳 游꼡 游본 游꼖 游꼙 游꼖 游볳 游꼖 游꼙
```

Swapping the middle `游꼙` with the `游꼖` below it will match three `游꼖` in a row.

```
 游볳 游꼡 游본

 游볳 游꼙 游꼙
```

The `游꼖`s disappear new items fall in from the top to fill in the blank spots.

```
 游볳 游꼚 游꼙 游볳 游꼡 游본 游볳 游꼙 游꼙
```

In this case, a new `游볳` fell down, triggering a combo.

```
    游꼚 游꼙 游꼡 游본 游꼙 游꼙
```

Again, new items fall in to replace the completed `游볳`s.

```
 游꼡 游꼚 游꼙 游꼖 游꼡 游본 游꼚 游꼙 游꼙
```

There are no more matches, so the player can take their next turn.

## Running the game

1. Type `npm install` to install all packages
2. Run `node game.js` to run the game
3. Run `mocha` to run tests

## Tasks

1. Implement tests in `test/bejeweled-spec.js` matching the bejeweled game logic
2. Update tests in `test/cursor-spec.js` to handle selecting and swapping gems
3. Fill out game logic in `class/bejeweled.js` until `mocha
   test/bejeweled-spec.js` passes all tests
4. Update cursor logic in `class/cursor.js` until `mocha
   test/cursor-spec.js` passes all tests
5. Use `setBackgroundColor` and `resetBackgroundColor` in `cursor.js` to
   highlight the cursor's current position on the grid, with a visual
   signifier when the cursor is in a "swap" state
6. Create commands in `bejeweled.js` to select gems and execute swaps
7. Fill out the game state in `bejeweled.js` that checks for match-3s.
8. Chain the game state to check and alert the player for match combos.
9. Implement a score for the player based on matches and combos.

## Screen API

`Screen` is a static class with the following methods. You do not need to
modify this class at all. The functionality you will need is documented below.

### Initialize

* `Screen.initialize(numRows, numCols)` will initialize a grid with the given
  dimensions.

### Initialize

* `Screen.setGridlines(gridLines)` will insert lines between each grid element
  is `gridLines` is true, or hide them if `gridLines` is false.

### Commands

* `Screen.addCommand(key, description, action)` will add a command that calls
  the `action` callback anytime `key` is typed on the keyboard. `description`
  will be displayed in the help message.
* `Screen.printCommands()` will show a list of all loaded commands and their
  descriptions.

### Updating the grid

* `Screen.setGrid(row, col, char)` sets the character at `row` and `col` to
  the given `char`.
* `Screen.setTextColor(row, col, color)` sets the text color at `row` and
  `col` to the given `color`.
* `Screen.setBackgroundColor(row, col, color)` sets the background color at
  `row` and `col` to the given `color`.

Valid colors are:
  * black
  * red
  * green
  * yellow
  * blue
  * cyan
  * white
  * magenta

### Quitting

* `Screen.setQuitMessage(quitMessage)` sets a message to be printed when the
  user quits.
* `Screen.quit(showMessage=true)` quits the game and prints the message if
  `showMessage` is true.

### Rendering

* `Screen.render()` will update the display. This must be called anytime the
  grid or messages change.

### Displaying a message

* `Screen.setMessage(msg)` takes in a string to be printed below the grid each
  time it is rendered.

#### How we are going to do this
  We are going to first focus on setting up the grid.

  # Phase 1
  We need to create an 8 by 8 grid which is already done. Change Screen.setGridlines to true.

  # Phase 2
  We need to make sure to be able to navigate thoughout the grid. To do so we need to implement cursor into the game through commands.

  # Phase 3
  We will focus on setting up the board. This will involve the specs.

  We need to make some adjustments to the screen class. We need to create static array that contains fruits that are already provided.
  The goal is randomly pull from the provided array to fill the grid.

  # Phase 4
  Since now we filled up the grid with fruits. We need to create commands that allow us to pick up a fruit and switch it with another.

  # Phase 5
    A method that checks for streaks horizontally/vertically
      if true, return true
      if all else fails, return false.

  # Phase 6
    We are going to make some adjustments to the streak checks
      if true, we will find the indices that make up a streak
      and return an array that contain object that represent coordinates

  # Phase 7
    We are going to use the array of objects that is return and use that to replace those elements with an empty string.

  # Phase 8
    We need to implement the an scenario where we look for combos.
    Luckly we already set our code for that case so we just need to add a while true statement.

  # Phase 9
    A method that records the amount of each fruit there is in the current context of the game
      Note: This become more of a thing with a smaller grid.
